        <p>Puzzle Game is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile
            missing.</p>
        <p>The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty
            space.</p>
        <p>This app was intentionally built to understand how the artificial intelligence algorithms solves the n-puzzle
            problem.</p>
